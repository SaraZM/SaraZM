      <description>Summary For this project we analyzed the spatial distribution of five Volatile Organic Compounds (VOCs) in Montreal, Canada. The goal for this project was to develop predicted surfaces that would be later used in health-related studies to test if the relationship between certain types of cancer and exposure to these VOCs.
We had measurements for three monitoring campaigns between 2005 and 2006 for over 130 locations in the city. Using hierarchical Bayesian models we proposed and fitted four different models that combined land-use regression and geostatistical methods to account for the potential spatial structure after accounting for the spatial covariates.</description>
