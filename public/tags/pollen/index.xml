      <description>Summary For this project we analyzed the spatial distribution of grass, weed and tree pollen in Toronto, Canada. The data consisted of weekly measurements of pollen concentration made between March and October 2018 for 17 locations. Our main goals were to generate a predicted surface for the concentration of pollen across the season while capturing the spatial and temporal variability through the sampled period.
The exacerbation of asthma and respiratory allergies has been associated with exposure to aeroallergens such as pollen.</description>
