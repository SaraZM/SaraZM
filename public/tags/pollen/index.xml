      <description>Abstract Background
The exacerbation of asthma and respiratory allergies has been associated with exposure to aeroallergens such as pollen. Within an urban area, tree cover, level of urbanization, atmospheric conditions, and the number of source plants can influence spatiotemporal variations in outdoor pollen concentrations.
Objective
We analyze weekly pollen measurements made between March and October 2018 over 17 sites in Toronto, Canada. The main goals are: to estimate the concentration of different types of pollen across the season; estimate the association, if any, between pollen concentration and environmental variables, and provide a spatiotemporal surface of concentration of different types of pollen across the weeks in the studied period.</description>
